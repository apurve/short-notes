Architecture has evolved into microservices, containers and orchestration infrastructure deployed on the cloud. Volume of data generated by these environments is constantly growing (TBs of log data a day).

Modern log management and analysis solutions should include the following key capabilities :
 - Aggregation – the ability to collect and ship logs from multiple sources.
 - Processing – the ability to transform log messages into meaningful data for easier analysis.
 - Storage – the ability to store data for extended time periods to allow for monitoring, trend analysis, and security use cases.
 - Analysis – the ability to dissect the data by querying it and creating visualizations and dashboards on top of it.

ELASTICSEARCH
Index - logical partitions of documents and can be compared to a database in the world of relational databases
Documents - Documents are JSON objects that are stored within an Elasticsearch index and are considered the base unit of storage. In the world of relational databases, documents can be compared to a row in a table.
