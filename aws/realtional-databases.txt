Ensurung Availability & Durability
    - Creating snapshots solves the issues but makes the DB slow.
    - Combining regural snapshots with tansaction logs solves slowness issue too.
    - Additionally we can introduce a Standby DB which is a mainatained vis synchronous replication.
    (Usually snapshots, transaction logs and replicas are maintained in different AZs)

Avaialbility - Will data be accessible whenever it is needed? 4-9s is preffered
Durability - Will I be able to access my data after 10, 100, 1000 years? 11-9s is preffered

RPO - Recovery Point Objective - Maximum acceptable period of data lose
RTO - Recovery Time Objective - Maximum acceptable downtime

HOT Standby - automatic synchronization of data, a standby is always ready to and automatic failover switches from master to slave DB (RPO-1min, RTO-5mins)
WARM Standby - automatic synchronization of data, standby is swapped when failure ocurs (RPO-1min, RTO-15mins)
Backup - snapshots and transaction logs are created regularly (RPO-1min, RTO-few hours)

String Consistency - Synchronous replication
Eventual Consistency - Asysnc replication
Read-after Writes Consistency
